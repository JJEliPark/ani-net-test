          First, generate points randomly to fill an ellipse with a 3:2 ratio. For the network connecting nodes based on title similarity, perform community detection using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvain_method">Louvain algorithm</a>. For each community, set the animation with the highest *rank as the representative value. Starting with the highest-ranked community, place the nodes sequentially from the center to the periphery.<br /><br />
          <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold', color: '#6E58FF' }}>Node Size</span><br /> The nodes are sized based on their popularity, segmented into the top 30, 100, 1000, and the remaining nodes, from a total of 2000 nodes. <br /><br />
          <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold', color: '#6E58FF' }}>Node Color</span><br /> The colors of the nodes represent the size of the cluster each node belongs to (number of works in the same series). Series with more than 6 works are shown in dark purple, series with more than 1 work are shown in purple, and individual works are displayed in light purple.. <br /><br />
          <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold', color: '#6E58FF' }}>Synopsis Keyword</span><br /> Utilizing the pre-trained Bert Base language model, 5 keywords were extracted from the synopsis for each animation. <br /><br />
          <span style={{ fontSize: 'small' }}>*Rank: Calculated by comprehensively considering Favorites, Views, Popularity, and Score from the Anime Dataset.</span>

        <p>
          <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold', color: '#6E58FF' }}>Title (Default)</span><br />
          The first part of each animationâ€™s title, split based on the colon, was embedded using a pretrained language model. Cosine similarity was calculated between the embeddings; nodes with high similarity were connected, while those with relatively lower similarity were connected only if they were produced by the same studio. Connections were not made if the cosine similarity was below 0.7. This approach illustrates the connections between animations within the same series.<br /><br />
          <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold', color: '#6E58FF' }}>Synopsis</span><br />
          Pretrained sentence embedding is applied, and nodes are connected if the cosine similarity is 0.65 or higher.<br /><br />
          <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold', color: '#6E58FF' }}>Contributors</span><br />
          Sentence embedding is applied to the studio names, connecting nodes with a cosine similarity of 0.85 or higher.<br /><br />
          <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold', color: '#6E58FF' }}>Genre</span><br />
          Genres are one-hot encoded, and nodes are connected if they have identical genre vectors.<br /><br />

      We developed an interactive visualization system using Sigma.js and React to represent anime networks based on a dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dbdmobile/myanimelist-dataset">Kaggle Anime Dataset 2023</a>. This filtered dataset includes animations and production companies from 1961 to 2023, allowing us to visualize relationships between different animations or production companies.
      <br /><br />
      We applied various Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms to the Node and Edge Attributes of the data. This approach provides additional insights that are not immediately apparent from the dataset alone, enabling a deeper understanding of the connections and patterns within the anime industry.
      <br /><br />
      The "Animation" network represents the relationships between different animations, while the "Studios" network illustrates the connections between studios, licensors, and producers. This distinction allows users to explore specific aspects of the anime industry in more detail.
